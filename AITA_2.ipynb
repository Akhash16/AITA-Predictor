To keep it out of his face while he is at work and to keep comfortable he wears bandannas. to put it simply: he wears them too much. I told him I wanted them to stay in his locker at work or in his truck. He told me that he enjoys wearing them around the house and when he is doing yard work because they are comfortable. But he won\\u2019t wear them out in public when we go somewhere together. I wasn\\u2019t particularly happy with that but I dealt with it until Friday. I dropped him off and picked him up from work so we could go to fleet farm and pick up some supplies for a project, he wore the bandanna he wore to work on the ride there, in the store, and all the way back home. I took all his bandannas when I woke up and threw them out the next morning. He claims he just didn\\u2019t think about it and I should\\u2019ve said something. I didn\\u2019t think I needed to since this was his compromise. AITA? ######\",\n          \"My daughter (15) had come to me to tell me that theres a possibility that social services or police might contact her and I would have to be there too. This is all because her best friend (also 15) had been telling her about how she had been abused by a relative. They have been texting about it, and my daughter had told a teacher instead of telling me about it first, which I understand that she was worried. This caused social services to be involved and the parents of her friend who didnt know about the abuse, contacted my daughter.\\n\\n\\nSo as she was telling me about this, many days later after actually reporting it, I told her she shouldnt have reported it. I said that she should have convinced her friend to tell a teacher or someone because I didnt want my daughter involved. I tried to explain to her that if the abuser and family found out that she reported it then maybe they could do something bad to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the end of the conversation she was crying, which is unlike her because I didnt realise she would be so sensitive about it. I told my sister about this whole situation and she thinks I'm right for saying that she shouldnt have gotten involved and not wanting my daughter to get too close to that friend anymore. However my daughter is upset about this all, so I'm not sure whether what I said was really that bad. I'm just trying to protect her, and dont want her involved and exposed to bad things. ######\",\n          \"My son is 25, working, living with us and paying rent. Since his bank account was created by us when he was younger, I have found out that for the past few months his savings were getting lesser and lesser and finally this month, emptied.\\n\\n\\nI had a talk with him and he got angry at me for checking his bank account when it was \\u201cnone of my business\\u201d, but admitted that he had been spending money on a particular mobile game. According to him, while the game itself is free-to-play, it is actually pay-to-win. He had been spending money on it and being a \\u201cbig player\\u201d, had fun crushing other players who did not spend as much.\\n\\n\\nI consider that bullying, as I believe games are supposed to be fun and it is not fun when only  1 side is having fun. Also, it seems to me that he has become addicted to it, spending his savings away like that. So after fail attempts to have him drop the game, with much discussion we have decided to double his rent starting next month\\n\\n\\nI told him that I will save the extra rent for him, and will only return them when he is mature enough to handle money better; he has enough money to get by. My son got very angry and told us that as an adult we have no right to tell him how to spend his money. He could move out but I doubt it, it is hard to get a place nowadays and he would just need to suck it up. Both my partner and I think that this is for the best, even if he resents us for it. AITA for dealing it this way? ######\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2461,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" YTA.

To keep it out of his face while he is at work and to keep comfortable he wears bandannas. to put it simply: he wears them too much. I told him I wanted them to stay in his locker at work or in his truck. He told me that he enjoys wearing them around the house and when he is doing yard work because they are comfortable. But he won\\u2019t wear them out in public when we go somewhere together. I wasn\\u2019t particularly happy with that but I dealt with it until Friday. I dropped him off and picked him up from work so we could go to fleet farm and pick up some supplies for a project, he wore the bandanna he wore to work on the ride there, in the store, and all the way back home. I took all his bandannas when I woke up and threw them out the next morning. He claims he just didn\\u2019t think about it and I should\\u2019ve said something. I didn\\u2019t think I needed to since this was his compromise. AITA? ######\",\n          \"My daughter (15) had come to me to tell me that theres a possibility that social services or police might contact her and I would have to be there too. This is all because her best friend (also 15) had been telling her about how she had been abused by a relative. They have been texting about it, and my daughter had told a teacher instead of telling me about it first, which I understand that she was worried. This caused social services to be involved and the parents of her friend who didnt know about the abuse, contacted my daughter.\\n\\n\\nSo as she was telling me about this, many days later after actually reporting it, I told her she shouldnt have reported it. I said that she should have convinced her friend to tell a teacher or someone because I didnt want my daughter involved. I tried to explain to her that if the abuser and family found out that she reported it then maybe they could do something bad to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the end of the conversation she was crying, which is unlike her because I didnt realise she would be so sensitive about it. I told my sister about this whole situation and she thinks I'm right for saying that she shouldnt have gotten involved and not wanting my daughter to get too close to that friend anymore. However my daughter is upset about this all, so I'm not sure whether what I said was really that bad. I'm just trying to protect her, and dont want her involved and exposed to bad things. ######\",\n          \"My son is 25, working, living with us and paying rent. Since his bank account was created by us when he was younger, I have found out that for the past few months his savings were getting lesser and lesser and finally this month, emptied.\\n\\n\\nI had a talk with him and he got angry at me for checking his bank account when it was \\u201cnone of my business\\u201d, but admitted that he had been spending money on a particular mobile game. According to him, while the game itself is free-to-play, it is actually pay-to-win. He had been spending money on it and being a \\u201cbig player\\u201d, had fun crushing other players who did not spend as much.\\n\\n\\nI consider that bullying, as I believe games are supposed to be fun and it is not fun when only  1 side is having fun. Also, it seems to me that he has become addicted to it, spending his savings away like that. So after fail attempts to have him drop the game, with much discussion we have decided to double his rent starting next month\\n\\n\\nI told him that I will save the extra rent for him, and will only return them when he is mature enough to handle money better; he has enough money to get by. My son got very angry and told us that as an adult we have no right to tell him how to spend his money. He could move out but I doubt it, it is hard to get a place nowadays and he would just need to suck it up. Both my partner and I think that this is for the best, even if he resents us for it.
